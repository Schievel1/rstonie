#+end_src

* Installation
** Using standalone binary
The ~rstonie-linux-x86_64-vx.y.z~ attached to the release is statically bound with musl and should therefore run on any (x86_64)Linux that is not ancient. (And maybe also Intel-Macs, but I never tested this)
So therefore just download this file, then make it executable
#+begin_src bash
~/Downloads > chmod +x ./rstonie-linux-x86_64-vx.y.z #replace x.y.z with the current version
#+end_src
Then run it:
#+begin_src bash

~/Downloads > ./rstonie-linux-x86_64-vx.y.z
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  <INPUT>
  <OUTPUT>

Usage: rstonie <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

For more information, try '--help'.
#+end_src

** Compiling
Get Rust ([[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]]), then clone this repo, cd into it and do
#+begin_src bash
cargo install --path ./
#+end_src
